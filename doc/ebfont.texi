@chapter Introduction

The @code{ebfont} command reads the bitmap data of the local defined
characters in a CD-ROM book, convert them to specified image formats,
and write them to files.
@code{ebfont} uses EB Library and it is distributed with the library.

@code{ebfont} is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

@code{ebfont} is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but @emph{without any warranty}; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  See the

This is edition @value{EDITION}, for EB Library version @value{VERSION}.

@c ===================================================================
@node What is Local Character, Invoking ebfont, Introduction, Top
@chapter What is Local Character?

Many CD-ROM books define their local characters.
For example, some English Japanese dictionaries define pronunciation
marks as the local characters because the character set used in CD-ROM
books doesn't have pronunciation marks.

CD-ROM books also have bitmap data of the local characters.
The @code{ebfont} command reads the bitmap data, convert them to a
specified image formats, and write them to files.
@code{ebfont} can generates image files as XBM (X BitMap format), XPM
(X PixMap format) and/or GIF (Graphics Interchange Format).
By default, XBM format is selected.

Local characters are classified to two types; @dfn{narrow} and @dfn{wide}.
In narrow type characters, the height of the bitmap data is about half
of its width.
In wide type characters, the width and height of the bitmap data are
almost same.
A CD-ROM book can defines local characters of both types.

The internal fomrat specification of CD-ROM book defines four heights
for local characters, for both narrow and wide types.
Their witdths, heights and sizes are follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .33
@item height  @tab  narrow  @tab  wide
@item 16      @tab   8x16   @tab  16x16
@item 24      @tab  16x24   @tab  24x24
@item 30      @tab  16x30   @tab  32x30
@item 48      @tab  24x48   @tab  48x48
@end multitable

@noindent
By deafult, @code{ebfont} generates image files for fonts with the
height of 16 pixels.

@chapter Invoking @code{ebfont}

Its usual way to invoke @code{ebfont} is as follows:

@example
% ebfont @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
@var{book-path} points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where
the file @file{CATALOG} or @file{CATALOGS} resides.
Though you cannot specify two or more book-paths, 
you can omit book-path like as follows:

@example
% ebfont
@end example

@noindent
In this case, it is assumed that the current working directory
(@file{.}) is specified.

@code{ebfont} generates image files under the current directory.
The generic forms of their filenames are:

@example
@group
@var{subbook}/@var{height}/narrow/@var{character-number}.@var{suffix}
@var{subbook}/@var{height}/wide/@var{character-number}.@var{suffix}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The @var{suffix} is @samp{xbm}, @samp{xpm} or @samp{gif}.
The @var{character-number} is a hexadecimal number with 4 digits
(@samp{0} to @samp{9}, and @samp{a} to @samp{f}), like this:

@example
@group
ejdict/16/narrow/a121.xbm
ejdict/16/wide/a321.xbm
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The intermediate directories such as @file{ejdict/16/xbm/narrow} are
created by @code{ebfont} if missing.

@code{ebfont} can outputs image files not only under the current
directory but also any directory by the @samp{--output-directory} option.
The top directory must have been created before invoking @code{ebfont}.

@example
% ebfont --output-directory @var{directory} @var{book-path}
@end example

@menu
* Image Formats::               Image Formats.
* Heights::                     Heights.
* Subbooks::                    Subbooks.

@node Image Formats, Heights, Invoking ebfont, Invoking ebfont
@section Image Formats

@code{ebfont} can generates image files of XBM, XPM and GIF (GIF89a)
formats.
These image formats are specified at the @samp{--image-format} (@samp{-i})
option.
The @samp{--image-format} option takes an argument which is a list of
image format mames separeted by a comma (@samp{,}).
For example, @code{ebfont} generates image files of XPM and GIF formats
by the following command:

@example
% ebfont --image-format xpm,gif @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
An argument to @samp{--image-format} can be splitted like as follows:

@example
% ebfont --image-format xpm --image-format gif @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
In the XPM and GIF formats, the foreground and background colors of 
images are black (@samp{#000000} in RGB) and transparency.
@code{ebzip} generates GIF images without LZW compression algolythm,
so that the their sizes are too fat.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Heights, Subbooks, Image Formats, Invoking ebfont
@section Heights

By deafult, @code{ebfont} generates image files for narrow and wide
fonts with the height of 16 pixels.
The @samp{--font-height} (@samp{-f}) option allows you to generate
image files of fonts with other heights.
The @samp{--font-height} option takes an argument which is a list of
font heights separeted by a comma (@samp{,}).
The font height must be @samp{16}, @samp{24}, @samp{30} and @samp{48}. 
For example, @code{ebfont} generates image files of fonts with the heights
of 16 and 24 pixels by the following command:

@example
% ebfont --font-height 16,24 @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
An argument to @samp{--font-height} can be splitted like as follows:

@example
% ebfont --font-height 16 --font-height 24 @var{book-path}
@end example

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Subbooks,  , Heights, Invoking ebfont
@section Subbooks

@code{ebfont} generates image files for all subbooks by default,
but the @samp{--subbook} (@samp{-S}) option allows you to generates
image files for specified subbooks only.

The @samp{--subbook} option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be compressed, separeted by a comma
(@samp{,}).
The @code{ebinfo} command tells you what subbooks your book contains
and what their directory names are.

@example
@group
% ebinfo /mnt/cdrom
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EXBA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 3

@end group
@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
  directory: english
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: french
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 3:
  title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: german
  search methods: menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(@xref{Invoking ebinfo, , Invoking @code{ebinfo}, ebinfo, ebinfo},
for more details about the @code{ebinfo} command).
@*
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their
directory names are @code{english}, @code{french} and @code{german}.

Inkoing the following command, @code{ebfont} generates image files for
@code{english} and @code{french} only.

@example
% ebfont --subbook english,french /mnt/cdrom
@end example

@noindent
Case of the directory names are not sensitve.
An argument to @samp{--subbook} can be splitted like as follows:

@example
% ebfont --subbook english --subbook french /mnt/cdrom
@end example
