@chapter Introduction

A CD-ROM book usually has some @dfn{subbooks}.
For example, a certain CD-ROM book has three subbooks; Japanese
dictionary, Japense English dictinary and English Japanese dictionary.
Each subbook itself is an independent @dfn{book}.

@example
@group
            (CD-ROM book)
+-----------------------------------+
|  [English Dicctionary] (subbook)  |
|  [Japanese Dicctionary](subbook)  |
|  [Encyclopedia]        (subbook)  |
+-----------------------------------+
@end group
@end example

A CD-ROM book of EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA format has the file
@file{CATALOG},
and a CD-ROM book of EPWING format has the file @file{CATALOGS}.
The files define what subbooks the CD-ROM book has.
They are resides at the top directory of the CD-ROM book.

@code{ebrefile} reads an original catalog file and builds a new catalog
file which defines the subbooks only specified by an user.
In other words, @code{ebrefile} can deletes particular subbook definitions
from a catalog file.
If a CD-ROM book has three subbooks, @code{ebrefile} can imports any
one or two subbooks to the new catalog file.
The @code{ebrefile} command is useful when you want to copy only a
part of a CD-ROM book to a hard disk. 
@code{ebrefile} is a part of EB Library distribution.

@code{ebrefile} is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

but @emph{without any warranty}; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

In addition, you must follow the licenses of your CD-ROM books.
Though @code{ebzip} is free software, your books may not be free.
@code{ebrefile} modifies contents of a certain file in a CD-ROM book.
Please be careful.

This is edition @value{EDITION}, for EB Library version @value{VERSION}.

@chapter Invoking @code{ebrefile}

Its usual way to invoke @code{ebrefile} is as follows:

@example
% ebrefile @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
@var{book-path} points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where
the file @file{CATALOG} or @file{CATALOGS} resides.
Though you cannot specify two or more book-paths, 
you can omit book-path like as follows:

@example
% ebrefile
@end example

@noindent
In this case, @code{ebrefile} assumes that the current working directory
(@file{.}) is specified.

@end menu

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Select Subbooks, Combination with ebzip, Invoking ebrefile, Invoking ebrefile
@section Select Subbooks

By default, @code{ebrefile} imports all subbook definitions in an original
catalog file to a new catalog file.
In short, the new catalog file is simply copied from an original.
The default behavoir is useless.
@code{ebrefile} is usually invoked with @samp{--subbook} (@samp{-S})
option.

The @samp{--subbook} option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be imported, separeted by a comma
(@samp{,}).
The @code{ebinfo} command tells you what subbooks your book contains
and what their directory names are.
Suppose that the current working directory is a top directory of a
CD-ROM book.

@example
@group
% ebinfo
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 3

@end group
@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
  directory: english
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: french
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 3:
  title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: german
  search methods: menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(@xref{Invoking ebinfo, , Invoking @code{ebinfo}, ebinfo, ebinfo},
for more details about the @code{ebinfo} command).
@*
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their 
directory names are @code{english}, @code{french} and @code{german}.

Invoking the following command, @code{ebrefile} build a new catalog file
which has definitions of @code{english} and @code{french} only.

@example
% ebrefile --subbook english,french
@end example

@noindent
Case of the directory names are not sensitve.
An argument to @samp{--subbook} can be splitted like as follows:

@example
% ebrefile --subbook english --subbook french
@end example

@noindent
Since @code{ebrefile} cannot change an order of subbook definitions,
the order of arguments to @samp{--subbook} is not matter.

@code{ebrefile} generates new catalog file as @file{CATALOGS(S).new}.
To replace original catalog file by new one, type the following
commands:

@example
% mv catalogs catalogs.bak
% mv catalogs.new catalogs
@end example

@noindent
If you don't have to backup the original file, only the second command
is needed.

Now, refiling has been completed.
Invoke @code{ebinfo} again.
The subbook @code{germgan} is diappeared.

@example
@group
% ebinfo
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 2
@end group

@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
  directory: english
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: french
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

If you have already copied whole the CD-ROM book onto a hard disk,
you may remove files of the subbook @code{german}.
When the directory name consists of lower case letters, type:

@example
% rm -r german
@end example

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Combination with ebzip,  , Select Subbooks, Invoking ebrefile
@section Combination with @code{ebzip}

@code{ebrefile} can be used together with the @code{ebzip} command,
which compresses files in a CD-ROM book
(@xref{Introduction, , Introduction, ebzip, ebzip}, for more details
about the @code{ebzip} command).
Usually, the same command line arguments are given to @code{ebzip}
and @code{ebrefile}.

Suppose that a CD-ROM book is mounted on @code{/cdrom}, and this
book has three subbooks; @code{english}, @code{french} and @code{german}.
By the following operation, the subbook @code{english} and @code{french}
are compressed and put under the current working directory, and the
subbook @code{german} are deleted from a subbook list.

@example
% ebzip --subbook english,french /cdrom
% ebrefile --subbook english,french /cdrom
@end example

@noindent
If you'd like to put the compressed files onto @file{/dict} instead
of the current working directory, type the following:

@example
% ebzip --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
% ebrefile --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
@end example

@item -S @var{subbooks}
@itemx --subbook @var{subbooks}
Specify subbooks which @code{ebrefile} imports to a new catalog file.
@var{subbooks} must be a list of directory names of subbooks separeted
