The @code{ebinfo} command outputs various information about a CD-ROM book.
@code{ebinfo} uses EB Library and it is distributed with the library.

@code{ebinfo} is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)
any later version.

@code{ebinfo} is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but @emph{without any warranty}; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

This is edition @value{EDITION}, for EB Library version @value{VERSION}.

@node Invoking ebinfo, Details about Information, Introduction, Top
@chapter Invoking @code{ebinfo}

Its usual way to invoke @code{ebinfo} is as follows:

@example
% ebinfo @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
@var{book-path} points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where
the file @file{CATALOG} or @file{CATALOGS} resides.
Though you cannot specify two or more book-paths, 
you can omit book-path like as follows:

@example
% ebinfo
@end example

@noindent
In this case, @code{ebinfo} assumes that the current working directory
(@file{.}) is specified.
@code{ebinfo} outputs information about the specified book like as
follows:

@example
@group
% ebinfo /mnt/cdrom
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 2

@end group
@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: ejdict
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: How to use the book
  directory: howto
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

If a subbook in the book supports multi-search, @code{ebinfo} also
outputs detail information about multi-search by specifying the
@samp{--multi-search} (or @samp{-m}) option.
The mulit-search information is like as follows.

@example
@group
  multi search 1:
    label 1: country or region
      with candidates: yes
    label 2: period
      with candidates: no
    label 3: category
      with candidates: yes
    label 4: authority
      with candidates: no
@end group
@group
  multi search 2:
    label 1: author
      with candidates: no
    label 2: title
      with candidates: no
    label 3: date
      with candidates: no
    label 4: publisher
      with candidates: no
@end group
@end example
